I am a PhD scholar in the Department of Aerospace Engineering & Engineering Mechanics, UT Austin working at the interface of machine learning and mechanics.  I am a member of the [PHO-ICES group](https://phoices.netlify.app/), [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/). I am particularly interested in Inverse problems, Scientific machine learning, Nonlinear estimation theory, Numerical techniques and Dynamic analysis. I work in collaboration with my advisor [Prof. Tan Bui-Thanh](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/bui-thanh) and have also previously worked with experts in the field of computational mechanics and mathematics such as [Prof. Phoolan Prasad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoolan_Prasad), [Prof. B. N. Rao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gklEogwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Prof. Mohammed Ameen](http://www.nitc.ac.in/index.php/?url=users/view/77/7/3).
