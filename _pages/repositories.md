- **[A Universal Law of Robustness via Isoperimetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12806)**

This paper provides mathematical insights into why overparametrized models are necessary to interpolate the data smoothly. In particular, the authors have used the term robustness (as measured by the Lipschitz constant of the function) to characterize smoothness in interpolation and show that overparametrization is necessary for reducing the lower bound of the Lipschitz constant. I found this paper particularly interesting since in my research, we use "robustness" as a desirable property for deep neural networks and use this as a criteria to devise a strategy for progressively adapting neural network to a given data-set.  Our  [algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06860) looks at a feasible way to control the upper bound of the Lipschitz constant which is then sufficient for robustness.
